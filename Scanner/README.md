## How to run
  * First download all the code and test file.
  * Move to code file directory, then run the following commands:
    ```
    $ make
    $ ./parser ../test/{test_file}.kpl
    ```
    {test_file} should be replaced by "example1 / example2 / example3".
    
## Causing Error
Modify the kpl code to cause errors while parsing.
